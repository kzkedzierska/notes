# Variants - theory


**Population stratification** (sometimes also called population admixture) 
describes the differences in allele frequencies between subpopulations because of ancestry.

Control: pick SNPs not related with disease and check whether they are significant.

## Single nucleotide variant (SNV)

https://www.quora.com/Genomics-What-is-the-difference-between-an-SNP-and-an-SNV

A SNV is a private mutation while a ﻿SNP is a mutation that is shared amongst a population

A polymorphism is something which is seen in atleast 1% of a population.
An SNP is a single nucleotide change(substitution) which we see in more than 1% members of a population.

A single nucleotide variation is just a variation in a single nucleotide without any limitations of frequency.

## PCA - broken stick method

PCA axes are sorted in descending order according to the amount of variance they extract – eigenvalues. How to decide, which axes are important and representative, e.g. for visualization of data? There are two options (following Borcard et al. 2011):

* **Kaiser-Guttman criterion** – calculate the mean of all eigenvalues and interpret only axes with eigenvalues larger than this mean;
* **broken stick model** – randomly divides the stick of unit length into the same number of pieces as there is PCA axes and then sorts these pieces from the longest to the shortest. Repeats this procedure many times and averages the results of all permutations (analytical solution to this problem is also known). Broken stick model represents eigenvalues, which would occur by random. One may want to interpret only those PCA axes with eigenvalues larger than values generated by broken stick model
